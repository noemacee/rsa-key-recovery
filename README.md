# rsa-key-recovery
While the RSA crypto system is secure whenever the modulus factors p and q are not disclosed, the knowledge of a non trivial portion of their bit values is sufficient to reconstruct their entire values. This project involves the implementation of a proof-of-concept of the attack on RSA keys with non-consecutive bits known with redundancy.
